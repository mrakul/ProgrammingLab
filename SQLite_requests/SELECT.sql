SELECT sql

-- WHERE name = 'Customers';                    -- or particular entity

--  GLOB:
    SELECT * FROM Customers

    ORDER BY cust_contact LIMIT 5;

-- Concatenation, RTRIM

-- ### Functions ###
-- DATE() and TIME()
    SELECT DATE('now') AS current_date;
    SELECT strftime('%H:%M:%S') /* TIME() */ AS current_time;
 -- UPPER, LENGTH
    SELECT vend_name,
           UPPER(vend_name) AS vend_name_upcase,
           vend_address,
           LENGTH(vend_address)
    FROM Vendors
    ORDER BY vend_name;

-- DATE comparing
    SELECT *
    FROM Orders
    WHERE strftime('%m', order_date) = "01" AND
          strftime('%Y', order_date) = "2020";
    -- OR =>  CAST(strftime('%m', order_date) as decimal) = 01;

-- ### Data Manipulation Functions and Summarazing Functions ###
-- 1:
    SELECT AVG(prod_price) AS AVG_PRICE,
           MAX(prod_price) AS MAX_PRICE,
           MIN(prod_name) AS FIRST_PRODUCT, -- check test Products
           COUNT(*) AS NUM_OF_PRODUCTS
    FROM Products;

-- 2: Subqueries:
    SELECT *
    FROM Products
    WHERE prod_price = (SELECT MIN(prod_price) FROM Products)
     OR prod_price = (SELECT MAX(prod_price) FROM Products);

-- 3: SUM
    SELECT SUM(quantity) AS ORDERED_NUMBER,
           SUM(item_price * quantity) AS TOTAL_PRICE
    FROM OrderItems
    WHERE order_num = 20005;

-- 4. SUBSTR example
    SELECT UPPER(cust_id) AS ID,

           UPPER(cust_city) AS CITY,
           UPPER(SUBSTR(cust_contact, 1, 2) || SUBSTR(cust_city, 1, 3)) AS LOGIN
    FROM Customers
    ORDER BY cust_id;
-- 4: AVG by unique values (DISTINCT keyword)
    SELECT AVG(DISTINCT prod_price) AS AVERAGE_OF_UNIQUE_PRICES
    FROM Products
    WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01';

    SELECT MAX(prod_price) AS MaxPrice
    FROM Products
    WHERE prod_price < 10; -- WHERE has more priority than MAX

-- ### GROUP BY ###
-- 1. First, WHERE filters the result for all rows. And HAVING filters after grouping
    SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS NUM_OF_PRODUCTS_PER_VENDOR --, prod_id, COUNT()
    FROM Products
        WHERE prod_price >= 4
    GROUP BY vend_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND vend_id GLOB "[BDF]*";
-- 2.
    SELECT order_num, SUM(quantity)
    FROM OrderItems
    GROUP BY order_num
    ORDER BY order_num;
-- 3 Challenge from Book:
    SELECT vend_id, COUNT(*) AS num_prods
        FROM Products
    GROUP BY vend_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND prod_price >= 4;
-- Number of items (positions) in every order
    SELECT order_num, COUNT() AS NUM_OF_ITEMS_PER_ORDER
    FROM OrderItems
    GROUP BY order_num
    ORDER BY order_num;

-- MIN_PRICE of a vendor's items
    SELECT vend_id, MIN(prod_price) as MIN_PRICE
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY vend_id
    ORDER BY MIN_PRICE;

-- Orders having more than 200 total items
    SELECT order_num, SUM(quantity)
    FROM OrderItems
    GROUP BY order_num
    HAVING SUM(quantity) >= 100;

-- Print out orders, money spent, customer ID and name for the orders having price more than 1000
-- (use INNER JOIN to show cust_id from Orders and cust_name from Customers)
    SELECT OrderItems.order_num, SUM(item_price * quantity) AS MONEY_SPENT, Orders.cust_id, Customers.cust_name
    FROM OrderItems

-- #11, Book: SUBQUERIES
-- 1. OrderItems -> Orders -> Customers
-- Print out Customers info who ordered 'RGAN01' product:
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    WHERE cust_id IN (SELECT cust_id

-- Strange example of a subquery
-- FROM Customers executed first. Then outer SELECT processed, and inner SELECT is executed for each customer row

    FROM Customers C
        LEFT JOIN Orders O ON C.cust_id = O.cust_id
    GROUP BY C.cust_id

-- #12, Book: JOINS
-- INNER JOIN
-- The request below prints out vendors and products info for the vendors who has products, that is
-- there are products in the Products table.
-- (LEFT JOIN will print out vendors also who has no products)

        ON C.cust_id = O.cust_id

        LEFT JOIN Orders O
        ON C.cust_id = O.cust_id
    GROUP BY C.cust_id
    ORDER BY C.cust_id;

--2. Count in how many Orders a particular Product presents:
-- LEFT JOIN is used to print out Products which are not ordered at all;
-- COUNT(OI.order_num) is used to not count NULLs
    SELECT P.prod_id, P.prod_name, COUNT(OI.order_num) INCLUDED_IN_ORDERS
    FROM Products P
    LEFT JOIN OrderItems OI
        ON P.prod_id = OI.prod_id

-- 3. How many Products every Vendor has
    SELECT V.vend_id, V.vend_name, COUNT(P.prod_id) NUM_OF_PRODUCTS
