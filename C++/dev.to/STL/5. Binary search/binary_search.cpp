/*** Binary search algorithms examples
 *  Important note: binary_search() takes ForwardIterators as input, not Random as expected.
 *  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/binary_search gives a note: "...However, for non-LegacyRandomAccessIterators, number of iterator increments is linear".
 *  binary_search() uses lower_bound() under the hood, and lower_bound() uses distance(first, last) and advance(it, step), so it is effective for vectors since translated easily to operating of addresses.
 *  For the rest of the containers (for example, for the list), this results in counting and iterating through the container actually by iterators.
