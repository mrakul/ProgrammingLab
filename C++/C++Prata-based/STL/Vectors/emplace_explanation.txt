A copy (or move) implies another object.
Construction does not.

Copy example for vec.push_back( A( 10, "hello" ) );

1) A temporary A is created on the stack
2)a) If A has a copy ctor, then the new object is copy constructed from the temporary
2)b) Otherwise the new object is default constructed, and the copy (assignment) operator is invoked to copy the temporary's value to the new object
3) The temporary object is destroyed

Move example for vec.push_back( A( 10, "hello" ) );

1) A temporary A is created on the stack
2) The new object is default constructed
3) The innards of the two objects are swapped ("moved")
4) The temporary is destroyed

Emplace example for vec.emplace_back( 10, "hello" );

1) The new object is constructed

Hope this helps.
