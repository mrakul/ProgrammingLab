    ### Output ###

git log -5 --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
-> show last 5 commits in the pretty mode

git show
->: show last commit or current commit

git remote -v
-> shows all remote repositories URLs
git branch -a
-> shows all remote and local branches

    ### Work with branches  ###
git rebase <branch1> <branch2>
-> rebases <branch2> to <branch1> and checkout to <branch2>

git checkout <commit/branch>
->  move HEAD to the commit/branch. If a commit specified, then the branch in a detached state.

git branch -f <branch>
-> move the specified branch to the current commit (where the HEAD now)

git reset --hard <commit>
-> moves the current branch's pointer to the commit

git checkout -b <new branch>
-> creates a new branch and checkout checkout it

    ### Cherry-pick ###
git cherry-pick <C1, C2 ... Cn>
-> pick up the specified commits for the current branch and move the branch to the last specified commit

    ### Garbage collector ###
git gc
-> removes the orphaned nodes

### Remotes ###
# If the branch is created remotely:
git fetch origin
-> will fetch the remote branch and create its remote representation
  >From https://github.com/mrakul/ProgrammingLab
  > * [new branch]      test2      -> origin/test2
  > git branch --remotes
  >  origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  >  origin/main
  >  origin/test2
// Then if try to checkout to the local, the branch is just created locally
git checkout test2
  > Switched to a new branch 'test2'
  > M       Git/git_commands.txt
  > Branch 'test2' set up to track remote branch 'test2' from 'origin'.

//If remote branches are deleted, but local remotes representation is still exists, this command "cuts"(prunes), removes their representation:
git remote prune origin
 > Pruning origin
 > URL: https://github.com/mrakul/ProgrammingLab.git
 > * [pruned] origin/test2
 > * [pruned] origin/test4


git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mrakul/ProgrammingLab.git  https://github.com/mrakul/CCpp-Projects-VS-Code.git
-> changes the origin's URL

git remote add upstream <URL>
-> set upstream URL

git push origin --delete test
-> (!) removes the remote branch (FROM THE REMOTE REPOSITORY) and its local reflection (origin/test)
-> Then you need to remove the local (not remote) branch separately
